		  <p>Parents need to know that R.L. Stine's Goosebumps series lives up its name. These well-written, spooky mysteries assume the paranormal is normal, that parents eat dinner guests, or kids turn into lizard-faced creepers. That premise aside, these books reflect the reality of young readers' worlds: They go visit relatives, or are bullied at school, or fight with a sibling or parent, or feel misunderstood, and the writing can pack an emotional hit. The kids in these fast-paced horror stories are in real danger -- from, for example, monsters trying to take over the world, or murderous ghost children trying to create more playmates in the afterlife -- and sensitive readers could take that danger to heart.</p>

		  <p>Parents need to know that Jeff Kinney's Diary of a Wimpy Kid is the first of a blockbuster multi-book series starring middle schooler Greg Heffley, who usually doesn't do the right thing the first time around. His cluelessness about what would keep him out of trouble and why parents, teachers, and friends are upset with him is part of the book's humor, which leads the reader to any lesson Greg should be learning. Parents will appreciate that Rowley's dad researches video games on a parent website to see if they have too much violence. Also, it is clear that Greg's mom is working hard to raise respectful sons.</p>

		  <p>Parents need to know that Mark Twain's classic, humorous novel The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, set in the pre-Civil War South in the mid-19th century, tells the story of a runaway White boy and a Black man who's a fugitive from slavery, and the adventures they have on the run. Main character Huck Finn first appeared in Twain's The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, and Tom appears in this book, too. The story includes abuse of whiskey, as well as child beating and other real and threatened violence (though little of it is graphic). Originally published in the United Kingdom in December 1884 and in the United States in February 1885, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn includes constant use of the "N" word, and it is frequently banned by libraries and school districts for its racist language and attitudes. However, Huck and Jim's humanity, and Huck's inner moral struggles as he questions what he's been taught about slavery actually expose the irrationality of racism.</p>

		  <p>Parents need to know that The Christmas Pig is a holiday fantasy by Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling. A boy named Jack loses his beloved stuffed pig before Christmas and he goes to the Land of the Lost to get it back. There are a few scares when Jack and his companion, the Christmas Pig, are chased by a giant baddie called the Loser who likes to eat Things, and by the Loser's minions who like to smash them and arrest them. There are also some sad moments as Jack, in the real world, hears his parents arguing before they get divorced and then moves to a new house and eventually gets a stepdad and a stepsister. For a story featuring toys, there are very few brands mentioned: Lego and Matchbox. And in the Land of the Lost Jack finds a mouth smoking -- one in a gang called the Bad Habits. Through his adventures, Jack learns that loss is part of life and what was lost can always live on in our hearts.</p>

          <p>Parents need to know Roald Dahl's novella Fantastic Mr. Fox is a charming story in which the animals outfox the farmers. Mr. Fox is a heroic father, rescuing his family from gunfire and starvation. He's also a friend to the other burrowing animals; the foxes share their feast with families of badgers, moles, weasels, and rabbits. Some alcohol is consumed in the story, as Mr. Fox, Badger, and one of the little foxes dig their way into Farmer Bean's cider cellar and they all swig down some of the home brew. There's also some violence against animals. The three farmers (Boggis, Bunce, and Bean) chase the foxes with guns and shoot Mr. Fox's tail off, and Mr. Fox kills chickens for his family to eat. But the witty and lighthearted story breezes past these events pretty quickly. Fantastic Mr. Fox was made into a delightful animated film, directed by Wes Anderson and starring George Clooney as Mr. Fox.</p>

<p>Parents need to know that Roald Dahl's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a classic children's book about five kids who win a chance to tour Willy Wonka's mysterious candy-making operation. It's a vividly told wild ride with amusing, cartoon-like sketches that will keep kids excited and laughing. Various forms of bad behavior are demonstrated, and are punished in ways that perfectly fit the crimes. Charlie lives a life of poverty that's portrayed as bleak and depressing, although the love between him and his family makes their day-to-day struggles more bearable. The book was adapted for a film titled Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory in 1971, and made into a movie titled Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, starring Johnny Depp, in 2005. That same year, it was released as an audiobook read by Monty Python member Eric Idle, which is loads of fun.</p>    </div>
